<p>GitHub Issues + Your Event = gitevents
You're organising a Developer user-group. You use GitHub Issues in your day job to manage your workflow. You're having trouble managing your event. Why not solve your problem with the tools you know.</p>

<p>gitevents uses a GitHub Issues to create, track and manage your Events as Milestones and book Talks as Issues, which a progressed through a simple Workflow as Labels.</p>

<p>It uses gitevents web-hooks to talk to a node.js service which listens to your GitHub Issues. This propogates events out to Social Networks (Facebook, Twitter, Google+) and Event Management sites (Tito, Meetup, Facebook, Google+) and keeps people informed (Tweets, Status Updates, Email).</p>
